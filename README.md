**Omnitrack**
The system consists of distributed and coordinated units placed on both generic objects and the user. Each unit can provide assistive feedback, such as light, sound, or vibration patterns, useful to the patient for space orientation. These feedback are generated real-time, based on how the user navigates through the space and their proximity to target objects. To achieve this goal, the system embeds functionalities to recognize the spatial positions and orientation of both the user and the objects, how the objects are manipulated, including actuators, lights, and speakers to deliver the feedback. For instance, Figure 1 illustrates a setup where the stimulus is generated by the network and each unit placed on the user and on the objects spread throughout the room generate sound and/or haptic vibrations.
